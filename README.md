# Introduction
This repository contains the code that I have been doing during the React course from Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/react-redux

During this course I have learnt about React and Redux doing several example projects for a further understanding of the concepts.

The master branch contains the boiler plate code for start the projects of this course.


In the following branches you can find the different projects that have been developed during the course:

* YoutubeExample
* BookExample
* BlogExample
* WeatherAppReactRedux
